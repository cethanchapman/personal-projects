Collection of random coding projects I have started. These projects aim to combine some of my interests while also expanding my knowledge. Not sure what I intend to do with the final products though. 


The first project you see is something I made to predict the final score of any college basketball game, with the help of statistics from kenpom.com. I used some pieces from an early assignment I did at Auburn for class in this project. I created an algorithm to quantify home and away games' impact on certain teams. I then implemented this algorithm and made it predict the final score of a game instead of calculating the dimensions of a 3D object. 

'Premier League Scrape' is an in-progress project. I have been following tutorials from the Dataquest YouTube channel(https://www.youtube.com/@Dataquestio/featured). These videos helped me learn how to scrape the footballreference site for useful data. I am trying to refine an algorithm that can predict the outcome of matches with some degree of accuracy. These concepts can also be applied to the profootball reference, basketballreference, and baseballrefence sites respectively. Those algorithms might take more work and research.
