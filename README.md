# personal-projects
Collection of random coding projects I have started. 


The first project you see is something I made to predict the final score of any college basketball game, with the help of statistics from kenpom.com. I used some pieces from an early assignment I did at Auburn for class in this project. I created an algorithm to quantify home and away games' impact on certain teams. I then implemented this algorithm and made it predict the final score of a game instead of calculating the dimensions of a 3D object.
